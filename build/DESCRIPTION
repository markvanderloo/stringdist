Description: Implements an approximate string matching version of R's native
     'match' function. Can calculate various string distances based on edits
     (damerau-levenshtein, hamming, levenshtein, optimal sting alignment), qgrams
     (q-gram, cosine, jaccard distance) or heuristic metrics (jaro, jaro-winkler).
     An implementation of soundex is provided as well. Distances can be computed
     between character vectors while taking proper care of encoding or between
     integer vectors representing generic sequences.
